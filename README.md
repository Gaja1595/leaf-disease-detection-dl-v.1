# leaf-disease-detection-dl-v.1
highly accurate model for leaf disease detection using deeplearning with the help of VGG-19 and Keras &amp; added output speed optimisation with implementation of higher workload on gpu compared to cpu.
Description: To analyse leaf disease picture dataset using Python and its modules with deep-learning algorithms to find the most accurate algorithm to help with disease detection.

*We will use the keras module from python which will help in pre-processing the images we have in the dataset obtained from kaggle.
Pre-Processing helps in making it easier for the CNN to distinguish between healthy and diseased leaf by highlighting or making a difference in the diseased or symptom showing part.

*VGG19 CNN:
VGG-19 is a convolutional neural network that is 19 layers deep.
You can load a pre trained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database.
As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images.
Advantages-
● faster training speed, fewer training samples per time, and higher accuracy.

*Keras:
Keras is a high-level, deep learning API developed by Google for implementing neural networks. It is written in Python and is used to make the implementation of neural networks easy. It also supports multiple backend neural network computation.
Advantages-
● Keras helps reduce cognitive load and offers simple api.


(PLANT VILLAGE dataset from kaggle) url:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease
Plant village is the dataset I have chosen to use in my project as it has 20,638 images of healthy and diseased plants of 15 different classes
This dataset takes into account leaves of 3 plants -
● Pepperbell(1+1)
● Potato(1+2)
● Tomato(1+9)


this project of mine is close to heart and will always be optimised and updated yearly; feel free to use the code for updation in your end in areas where u implement the same modules and ideologies and do correct me if u find a better and more optimised approach to this problem.
